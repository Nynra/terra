### Features:
- **Wander Without Your Phone**: TERRA invites users to leave their smartphones behind and reconnect with their surroundings. The standalone device boasts a minimalist interface, featuring a tranquil compass needle and gentle haptic feedback to ensure users remain engaged with the present moment. 
- **Improvised Trails, Powered by AI**: Every journey begins with a prompt. TERRA’s sophisticated AI translates your intentions, available time, and precise location into a tailored trail of GPS coordinates. Users don't know where TERRA will take them; the only certainty is finding their way back to the starting point.
- **Open-Source by Design**: TERRA is designed with a DIY mindset. Anyone can download the open-source software, 3D print the CAD designs, assemble the necessary hardware, and start wandering.
